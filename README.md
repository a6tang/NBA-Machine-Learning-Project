# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze trends within the NBA by utilizing pandas dataframes, principal component analysis, logistic regression, and heatmaps. Specifically, this project analyzes:
-  The average number of points per game for players who won All NBA First, Second, and Third teams (not the All Defensive Teams), as well as for players who were in the All-Star Game (not the rookie all-star game)
-  The average number of years of experience in the league it takes for players to make their first All NBA Selection (1st, 2nd, or 3rd team)
-  The career outcome (Elite, All-Star, Starter, Rotation, Roster, Out of the League) of nba players based on various statistics

This project also includes a model that predicts nba career outcomes for current players. This model utilizes principal component analysis, a logistic regression classifier, and a heatmap. The model outputs the probability of each player's career outcome (Elite, All-Star, Starter, Rotation, Roster, Out of the League).

This project also includes a relatively simple rebounds prediction model.

The process of this project includes a problem statement, data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, modelling, results, limitations, and potential weaknesses.
